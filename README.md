# Unique Component Analysis (UCA)

A technique to carry out contrastive Principal Component Analysis with multiple backgrounds based on Lagrange Multipliers.
UCA can be used with multiple background data to remove known variation from multiple sources and implemented to handle high-dimensional data.
