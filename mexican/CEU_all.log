Reading map (extended format) from [ hapmap_CEU_r23a.bim ] 
3967651 markers to be included from [ hapmap_CEU_r23a.bim ]
Scan region on chromosome 23 from [ rs4472693 ] to [ rs4893106 ]
Reading pedigree information from [ hapmap_CEU_r23a.fam ] 
90 individuals read from [ hapmap_CEU_r23a.fam ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 90 missing
44 males, 46 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ hapmap_CEU_r23a.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 117727 SNPs
60 founders and 30 non-founders found
177 heterozygous haploid genotypes; set to missing
Writing list of heterozygous haploid genotypes to [ CEU_all.hh ]
0 markers to be excluded based on HWE test ( p <= 0.0001 )
	0 markers failed HWE test in cases
	0 markers failed HWE test in controls
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.985778
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 0.2 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 117727 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 90 missing
After filtering, 44 males, 46 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
