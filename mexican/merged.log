111472 (of 111472) markers to be included from [ GUA.map ]
Scan region on chromosome 23 from [ rs1921964 ] to [ rs498000 ]
50 individuals read from [ GUA.ped ] 
50 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 50 controls and 0 missing
24 males, 26 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Using merge mode 1 : consensus call (default)
Merging 7 samples, final sample contains 374 individuals and 227478 markers
Filtering males only ... 207 individuals remaining
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 227478 SNPs
193 founders and 14 non-founders found
Writing list of removed individuals to [ merged.irem ]
207 of 207 individuals removed for low genotyping ( MIND > 0.01 )
0 markers to be excluded based on HWE test ( p <= 0.0001 )
	0 markers failed HWE test in cases
	0 markers failed HWE test in controls
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0
227478 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 0.2 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 0 SNPs

ERROR: Stopping as there are no SNPs left for analysis
